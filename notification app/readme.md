📦 Project: Toast Notification App
📝 Description:
This project is a Toast Notification App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to display temporary notifications for different states — Success, Error, Warning, and Info — each styled with appropriate colors and icons.

The user can trigger these notifications by clicking on the corresponding buttons. The toasts appear in the top-right corner and fade out automatically after 3 seconds. The app uses animations to enhance the user experience and demonstrates clean separation of logic (notification.js) and styling (style.css).

🚀 Features:
4 notification types with unique icons and colors

Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds

Smooth slide-in and fade-out animation

Responsive button layout

Easy to customize and extend

🛠️ Tech Stack:
HTML – Structure and buttons

CSS – Styling, layout, and animations

JavaScript – Logic for toast creation and timing

🔚 End Keyword: #toast-end
You can use #toast-end or any other custom keyword to mark the end of the documentation or to reference this version in your project log.
